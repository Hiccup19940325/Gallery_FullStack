## ❯ Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then setup your application environment.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```
> This installs all dependencies with npm. So after that your development environment is ready to use.

### Running in dev mode

- Run `npm run dev` to start nodemon with tcs-watch, to serve the app.
- Frontend server address will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend server address will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:5000`
